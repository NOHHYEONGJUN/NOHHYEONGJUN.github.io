        # Empathetic AI Diary

        <br><br><br>

        ## Project Introduction
        - When users write a diary in the mobile application, it analyzes and categorizes it into one of six emotions using the **KoBERT model**
        - A service that provides **empathy and comfort** tailored to user emotions using a **fine-tuned LLM model**
        - Building a **zero-downtime, high-availability service** using **AWS EKS and RDS**

        <br><br>

        ## 1. Technology Stack
        1. **AI and Models**
           - KoBERT (Emotion Analysis)
           - LLM (Empathetic Dialogue Generation)

           <br>

        2. **Cloud Infrastructure**
           - AWS EKS (Kubernetes)
           - AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)

           <br>

        3. **Development Environment**
           - Python (KoBERT and LLM)
           - Container
           - React-Native Expo
           - Nest.js
           - PostgreDB
           - CoLAB

           <br>

        4. **CI/CD**
           - Jenkins
           - GitLab
           - ArgoCD
           - Harbor
           - SonarQube

           <br>

        5. **Monitoring**
           - Prometheus
           - Grafana
           - AWS CloudWatch

           <br>

        6. **Collaboration Tools**
           - Notion

           <br><br><br>

        ## 2. Project Duration and Schedule Management
        Project Duration
           - September 13, 2024 ~ December 7, 2024

           <br>

        Schedule Management
           - Task progress and resource management through Notion
           - Weekly Agile scrum meetings

           <br><br><br>

        ## 3. Project Differentiators
        - Enhanced user experience through **AI-based emotion analysis** and **personalized dialogue generation**
        - Providing stable service through **high-availability infrastructure**
        - Improved accuracy and empathy in emotion analysis and response by combining **KoBERT and LLM models**

        <br><br><br>

        ## 4. Improvement Goals
        1. **Model Optimization**
              - Continuously improve the performance of KoBERT and LLM to provide better emotion analysis and empathetic dialogue

              <br>

        2. **Enhance User Experience**
              - Strengthen personalized services through diverse emotion analysis and empathetic responses

              <br>

        3. **Strengthen Infrastructure Scalability**
              - Continuously optimize high-availability infrastructure to prepare for an increase in the number of users
